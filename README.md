# keypress

A raw keyboard input reader
---

Why? Have you ever developed a terminal program dealing with keyboard input? That is why.

### 1. Description

**Keypress** generates a byte-by-byte representation of keyboard inputs, whether for individual keys or key combinations. This representation includes the following formats: hexadecimal, octal, decimal, and the corresponding symbols.

Multi-byte sequences —such as extended ASCII, Unicode, or key combinations involving function keys and arrow keys— will produce multiple lines of output, with each line representing a single byte in the sequence.

Please be aware that the generated byte values may vary depending on the terminal emulator used.

Within the program, press <kbd>Ctrl+c</kbd> to quit or <kbd>Ctrl+x</kbd> to clear the screen.

Please note that these key combinations are reserved for controlling the program's flow, so they will not be represented in the output. For reference, the byte values for these keys are:

```
 ┌──────┬──────┬─────┬──────┐
 │ Hex   │ Oct  │ Dec  │ Sym  │
 ├──────┼──────┼─────┼──────┤
 │ \x18 │ \030  │  24 │  CAN  │ (Ctrl+x)
 │ \x03 │ \003  │   3 │  ETX  │ (Ctrl+c)
 └──────┴──────┴─────┴──────┘
```
